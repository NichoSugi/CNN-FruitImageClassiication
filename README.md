# CNN-FruitImageClassiication

 This project focuses on building a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to classify images of different types of fruits. The CNN will be trained on a dataset containing images of various fruits such as apples, bananas, oranges, and grapes. By leveraging CNN's strength in image processing, the model will learn to recognize distinct visual features like color, texture, and shape, allowing it to accurately classify the fruits into their respective categories.
